Steps to run the app:
1) First you need to run "pip install -r requirements.txt". This will install all the required packages for the web app.
2) Go inside the Vuln_App folder and run "python run.py". This should start the web app on localhost on port 5000. 

If you need to clear out the database (usernames and passwords), uncomment the db.drop_all() line in __init__.py and run it again. You can comment it back in after running it once if you like.
